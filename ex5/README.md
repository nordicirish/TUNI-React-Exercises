Exercise 5  
(deadline: November 25, 2021, 23:59 EET)

● Create a React project using the default template of create-react-app (using the command npx create-react-app ex5). Modify and add 
necessary files creating a React application featuring at least three separate (logical) "pages" (views) so that
– they are implemented as separate React components,
– each of them presents different visible content and is easily distinguishable from the others,
– only one of them is visible at a time, and 
– users can easily navigate between them via a menu bar or a dropdown menu (select the page to be shown from a menu).

● Routing in the application should work in such a way that 
– users can navigate between the views using, e.g., the "back" and "forward" buttons of the browser in the fashion one could expect, and
– the address visible on the address bar of the browser is different for each view, and one can reach a view by directing the browser to the 
corresponding address.
